   - Analyzing Google Search Data to assess the search volume trends for different themes, helping us gauge consumer interest over time.

2. Evaluating Brand Positioning:
   - Mapping themes to specific products using the "Theme_Product_List" dataset to determine which products are associated with each theme.
   - Comparing the client's brand positioning with that of their competitors based on the products and themes they are associated with.

3. Identifying Sales Drivers:
   - Correlating the sales data with different themes to understand which themes have the most significant impact on product sales.
   - Identifying the key factors driving sales performance, which will assist the client in optimizing their product offerings and marketing strategies.

The insights gained from this analysis will enable Manufacturer A to make data-driven decisions, enhance brand positioning, and strengthen its market presence.
