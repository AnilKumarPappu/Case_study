To achieve the project's objectives, we will follow a systematic approach that involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and employing appropriate modeling techniques. The key steps of our modeling approach are outlined below:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleaning the Sales Data to remove duplicates and handle missing values.
   - Integrating the various datasets, including Social Media Data, Google Search Data, Theme_Product_List, and Product_Manufacturer_List.
   - Transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Conducting an in-depth EDA to gain insights into the distribution of themes, product sales, and their relationships.
   - Visualizing trends in social media mentions, search volume, and sales to identify patterns and correlations.

3. Theme Analysis:
   - Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment and frequency of social media mentions for different themes.
   - Evaluating the popularity of themes over time using time series analysis on Google Search Data.

4. Brand Positioning Analysis:
   - Employing clustering algorithms to identify groups of products associated with similar themes.
   - Comparing the client's product clusters with those of competitors to assess brand positioning.

5. Sales Drivers Identification:
   - Conducting correlation analysis between sales data and theme popularity to determine the impact of themes on sales.
   - Utilizing feature importance techniques to identify the key drivers of product sales.

6. Reporting and Visualization:
   - Presenting the findings using clear and concise visualizations, charts, and graphs.
   - Documenting the modeling process and outcomes for better reproducibility and future reference.

By following this approach, we aim to provide Manufacturer A with actionable insights and data-driven recommendations to enhance their market position and drive business growth.
